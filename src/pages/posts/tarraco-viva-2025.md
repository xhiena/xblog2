TarracoViva is the Roman Festival from Tarragona. This year run from 12 May to 25 May and It was <a href="https://tarracoviva.com/tarraco-viva-2025/el-festival-a-un-cop-dull/" target="_blank">packed of activities!</a> (warning, info is only in spanish or catalonian)

We did enjoy a weekend full of recreations and talks, and we did also create a small mosaic like they did it on the ancient rome. we did adquire some books from the literary corner :p (we can't stop buying books!).

It was really good, and I do encourage everyone to visit it atleast once.
