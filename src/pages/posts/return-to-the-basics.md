I miss writing in a blog, it's been, ... I don't remember how many years have passed since my last active blog. Not that I was a great blogger, but I do miss it. Sharing what I found, what I do.

I did try to create other blogs, trying some CMS, different hostings,... but... wordpress has become too comboluted and heavy, other php options are not drop and play too, so I've decided going simple, and have a static files blog.

So I've tried some generators and the one that I liked the best is <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro</a>. From all the generators that I tried, this was the only one that the tutorial examples worked, and even when I did fuck up they have a discord full of amazing people that will help you (and they did help me)

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come. (This line comes from the post-1 in their tutorial :p but it explains it really good). Also I will fiddle with the css and structure of the page till I like it enough.
